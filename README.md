```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Customizing Mock Data

Currently, the app uses mock data for demonstration. To modify prices, edit the mock_prices dictionaries in the scraper methods:

```python
mock_prices = {
    "milk": 65.0,
    "bread": 25.0,
    "eggs": 85.0,
    # Add more products
}
```

### Adding Real Web Scraping

To implement real web scraping:

1. Study each platform's HTML structure
2. Handle dynamic content loading
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add rate limiting and respect robots.txt
